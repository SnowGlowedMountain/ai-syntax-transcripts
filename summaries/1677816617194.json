  "\n\nThe announcer starts by introducing a new web development show that will air on Mondays. The show promises to cover various topics, including JavaScript, CSS, workflow, soft skills, and web development trends. The announcer also adds that the show will be crazy yet tasty. The speakers for the show are named as Sarah CUDA, Bob, and Scott El Toro.",
  "\n\n\nIn this episode of Syntax, the speakers Scott Tolinki and Wes Bos talk about the importance of logging in applications. While logging is often done for debugging purposes, many developers fail to recognize its usefulness in both development and production environments. Scott Tolinki, a developer from Denver who co-hosts the podcast with Wes Bos, introduces the topic of logging at the start of the episode.",
  "In this video, speaker Wes Bos talks about the importance of logging and how it has helped him solve issues with his app. He notes that he has been taking logging more seriously lately due to some Gremlins in his app that he couldn't figure out. By updating his logging, he gained more insight into what was happening in his app. Bos mentions that he primarily uses console logging, but he talks about how Sentry, the sponsor of the video, offers more advanced features such as performance and session replay that can help identify and solve issues without relying solely on logs. Bos also provides a brief explanation of logging and its significance in software development. Finally, he encourages viewers to check out Sentry and use the coupon code \"tasty treat\" for two months of free usage.",
  "In this video, Scott Tolinski introduces the concept of logging and how it can be used in coding. He explains that logging is a way to give visibility to some action that is happening on your server or client, with the most basic form being a console log. Tolinski notes that logging can be used for quick debugging, but also can provide more complex information, such as explaining requests or giving information about the duration of an action. He also mentions that other frameworks and CMS often have logging capabilities built in. Overall, logging provides a way for developers to understand what is happening in their code and various systems.",
  "In this video, Wes Bos discusses the importance of logging in programming. Logs can be helpful for developers to figure out what happened in case of errors or issues, or to track what endpoints are being hit with specific data. Logs can also be used to keep a record of important events, such as when an email is sent. Logging helps with finding the cause of issues and is useful in situations where data may need to be pieced back together, such as when a database crashes. Logs can be parsed to recreate important data in the database, even if some information is lost.",
  "In this video, Scott Tolinski talks about logging and its importance in software development. He emphasizes that logging is not just for debugging but also for general information and understanding of what's going on in the application. He explains that logging is different from error handling because it provides both less targeted and more targeted information. Less targeted info gives an overview of what's happening in the application whereas more targeted info provides context into what could be potentially going wrong in a given instance. In summary, logging is necessary for developers to gain insight into what is happening in their application and pinpoint potential errors.",
  "Wes Bos discusses his experience with monitoring website activity through console logs. He describes seeing users progress through the process of visiting his website, purchasing a course, and creating an account. a particular issue he faced involved undefined requests in his logs when users clicked on magic links. Bos traced the issue to a typo in his website's template that caused an image tag to request the current URL as its source. Bos resolved the issue by fixing the typo and adding additional logging to monitor user activity.",
  "In this video, Scott Tolinski discusses the benefits and potential drawbacks of using logs in server-side logging. He mentions that logs can be helpful for debugging issues but can also create too much noise. Tolinski recommends logging the timecode, request type, requested path, total response time, and type of log (e.g., error, information) in a structured and organized way. Tolinski suggests that error logs could be color-coded to make them stand out. He emphasizes the importance of having timestamps in logs to make it easier to nail down exactly when an event occurred. Overall, Tolinski suggests that carefully selecting what information to include in logs and organizing them in a structured way can be helpful for quickly identifying and resolving issues.",
  "In this conversation between the speakers Wes Bos and an unknown person, they discuss the topic of logging and how they currently log information in their applications. Wes Bos suggests that they discuss how they log specifically in this episode, and shares his own method of logging which involves creating an ID or name for each area of the application and adding relevant information such as URLs, query parameters, and body parameters. He mentions that logging the entire request object would make logs too large quickly, and wonders if other developers log the entire request object.",
  "This text is very brief and does not contain enough information to provide a detailed summary. It appears to be a fragment of a larger conversation and without additional context, it is impossible to determine the subject matter or significance of the speaker's words.",
  "\n\nIn this video, Wes Bos talks about managing log files and how having too many log files can cause issues. He shares a personal experience where he had log files get into the gigs and he couldn't figure out why his server would slow down until he rebooted it. He later discovered that using Forever, an app that puts logs in a log file, was the cause of the issue. It turned out that he was running out of space on his server, making it slower and slower until he cleared out the logs. Therefore, he believes that having a better approach for managing log files is important.",
  "\n\nAt 11:52, Scott Tolinski says he has received emails indicating his server space is limited due to running out of space. He notes that logging every request can generate a lot of text, which many developers forget takes up storage space since text is equal to bytes. Storing a lot of information like this through writing can easily occupy storage space.",
  "\n\nAt the timestamp 12:24, Wes Bos mentions that when a website gets 100,000 requests per day and logs a few lines for each one, it adds up quickly. Bos highlights the importance of being mindful of the data recorded because even small amounts can quickly result in significant amounts of data.",
  "\n\nIn this text, Scott Tolinski discusses a system he uses for information logging in requests using emojis. He starts counting the response time from when the request comes in and stops counting when the response is going out through middleware. Depending on how fast or slow the response time is, different emojis are used to represent it. A rocket ship is used to represent a fast response time, a bunny rabbit for a shorter response time, and a turtle for a long response time. He finds this visual-based system helpful for identifying issues in specific routes or components.",
  "\n\nIn this segment, Wes Bos talks about the importance of logging descriptive messages about what happened during certain events, such as login attempts, but warns against logging personally identifiable information as it may raise concerns about privacy laws like GDPR. He advises ensuring that logs are updated, and potentially removing irrelevant data when a user requests to be deleted from the database.",
  "\n\nIn this conversation, Scott Tolinski highlights the importance of securing logs as they could become another attack vector. He suggests that even if someone gets access to the logs, it could be as bad as them getting access to the information itself as the information is just sitting there. Therefore, it's important to ensure that anything that needs to be secure in the log is secure. The timestamp for this conversation is 14:21.",
  "\n\nIn this video, Wes Bos discusses the importance of careful logging practices when it comes to permissions and restricting access to information. Bos advises that developers need to be careful not to put anything in logs that other employees who don't have authorization can access, especially if it may insult other employees. Bos also mentions the different levels of logging, such as error warning, verbose, and silly, and suggests that logging everything can be helpful for following requests along. He mentions the ES lint's silly mode, where it logs every single step of the process. Bos also highlights the importance of breakpoints in code to understand what the code is doing.",
  "Scott Tolinski discusses the use of logging in development versus production environments. He explains that in development, logging can be used to get better visibility into what's going on, but in production, he keeps most of his normal informational logging. Logging is helpful to see what's happening in the site, and it's nice to be able to evaluate the speed of the site. Tolinski also mentions that he uses emojis in the logs, which are only server-side and don't affect the client-side logging experience. He advises against outputting too many things to the client in production, unless it's for fun.",
  "In this text, Wes Bos shares that he often leaves console logs in his code, citing instances where it was helpful in troubleshooting errors. He recommends using Sentry's breadcrumbs feature, which shows which functions were called up to the error, and includes any console logs. Bos found this to be useful in diagnosing issues, as he was able to gain insight into what was happening by reviewing the breadcrumbs. He emphasizes that this tip is not part of a sponsored mention. The timestamp for this segment is 16:41.",
  "\n\nAt 17 minutes and 34 seconds into the video, Scott Tolinski says that visibility and debugging are important aspects of troubleshooting. He emphasizes that logging plays a critical role in this process. Tolinski mentions that an effective way to debug is by having logs that capture the details of a system's operations. He expresses his delight in seeing logs indicating that someone attempted to access WP admin.",
  "Web developer Wes Bos discusses the issue of bot logs and their impact on website security in a conversation at the 17:50 timestamp. Bos explains that bots attempt to hit common endpoint spots and submit forms with random data. He recounts a recent experience with a bot that attempted to submit Postgres SQL injections, even though he doesn't use Postgres anywhere. The bot continued to attempt the injections for around six or seven hours until Bos added a CAPTCHA to the form. Bos notes that it's important to log any throttling or rate limiting that takes place in the app level to prevent bots from figuring out the limit for the website. Despite taking days to complete, bots will still attempt to do so.",
  "\n\nScott Tolinski shares a personal experience with automating browser tasks and avoiding rate limiting. He mentions using a set timeout in a loop to prevent getting hit by the limiting feature. He suggests adjusting the interval time to find the optimal number for success, and reveals his own successful number to be 400 milliseconds.",
  "In this text, Wes Bos talks about where to put logs for a service. He explains that the service can handle logs itself and stream them in for users to access in the dashboard or one can access log files from a VPS server like Linode or Digital Ocean. He notes that log files can be massive, but text editors are great at opening and searching through them now. Services that do hosting allow log drains to keep logs for a specific period of time, after which they're deleted. If one needs to keep logs for longer, they have to port them into something else like a text file on AWS or a specific log drain service that offers syntax highlighting, filtering, sorting filters, and graphs. However, he notes that the cost of using these services may not be worth it.",
  "In this video, Scott Tolinski talks about logging tools and services. He mentions several popular tools such as logtail and paper trail, as well as others like sumo logic, log DNA, logs.io, sematext, data dog, logic monitor and Dynatrace. He notes that while some of these tools offer more than just logging, logtail and paper trail are the two most widely used tools for logging. Scott goes on to say that these tools are useful for diagnostic purposes and can help in finding specific instances or issues in logs. However, for his level of work, they are unnecessary expenses as he can dive into the log files and obtain the same information. He concludes that if he were working on a bigger project with a bigger team, a logging tool like this would be essential.",
  "\n\nIn this excerpt, speaker Wes Bos discusses the options for logging in JavaScript applications. He explains that while he personally uses the console log method, there are other packages available such as Winston which allow for more customization and context logging. However, he confesses that he doesn't like the idea of having to import a package into every file, though he acknowledges that this may not be as much of an issue now with auto import in VS code. He ends by asking if the listener uses a specific logging package.",
  "Scott Tolinski is discussing his experience using the Pino logging package from Matteo Kalina. He praises the package for its robustness and low overhead, citing its ability to handle logging for FASTA, Phi, and Mercurius. However, instead of using it in a way similar to console log, he suggests using it as a middleware to intercept errors or requests. For everything else, he recommends using console log.",
  "\n\nIn this conversation, Wes Bos suggests the idea of doing a show on middleware. The conversation partner agrees, acknowledging that they have never done a show on middleware before. The timestamp of this exchange is 24:03.",
  "\n\nAt 24:08, Scott Tolinski explains that he wrote a middleware to aid in his work with forms. He had been using Intel Kit to automatically parse foreign data from their forms and make them available along with a spell kit form action. This middleware appears to streamline the data entry process for forms.",
  "cannot wait to try it out. I've got a few ideas for some new patches and new things to add to it. But, yeah, it's been really interesting to see you work on this over the past couple of months, and I'm really excited to dive in and kind of see what's possible. What was the timeline like for you building this? When did you actually start working on it? \n\nUnknown Speaker 24:40\nI started working on it early this year, maybe around March or April. I had the idea for a while, but it didn't really click until I started playing around with some of the concepts of probability and chance. \n\nWes Bos 24:51\nSo for those who haven't seen it yet, how would you describe it?\n\nUnknown Speaker 24:55\nIt's basically a Max for Live device that generates random MIDI notes based on a set of probabilities that you can set up by dragging around on a matrix. So you can think of it like a probability sequencer, where you're able to kind of take some of the control out of your hands and let the machine generate some random patterns for you.",
  "\n\nIn this segment, the speaker Scott Tolinski mentions that he has a few code snippets in his codebase which he has not yet published. He specifically mentions a spell kit logging code and another one created by one of his colleagues, Hannah. He also says that it took him a few minutes to put the code live on the internet. The timestamp for this segment is 24:22.",
  "\n\nIn this conversation, Wes Bos and an unknown speaker discuss the issue of TypeScript types not updating for requests that come after middleware. Wes Bos mentions that while he uses lots of middleware, he wishes that TypeScript types would update for requests that come after middleware, as it is currently difficult to know whether the middleware has been run before. The other speaker agrees that this can be a problem, but suggests that they throw it on the Bucks middleware. They then move on to discussing logs.",
  "\n\nThe speaker, Scott Tolinski, suggests that the conversation may be coming to an end as he says \"I think that might be it.\" The timestamp is 25:13. The context and details of the conversation leading up to this statement are not provided.",
  "\n\nIn this segment, speaker Wes Bos suggests that it is important to log information that one thinks is necessary to add to their application. He advises taking a couple of minutes to better log information in one's app, as it can be helpful to have access to that information later on. By doing so, one can avoid regretting not having better logging in place when it becomes necessary.",
  "\n\nThe text consists of only one line spoken by Scott Tolinski at timestamp 25:32. The text does not provide any context to understand the meaning behind his statement.",
  "Bruce  25:37\nHold on, Wes. Before we go, I just want to remind everyone that our company's annual charity event is coming up next month. As you all know, this event is a big part of our community outreach program, and we are committed to making a positive impact in the lives of others.\n\nWes Bos  25:56\nAbsolutely, Bruce. I'm glad you brought that up. Can you tell us a little more about the event and how people can get involved?\n\nBruce  26:02\nSure thing, Wes. The event is a 5K run and walk that we host every year to raise funds for a local non-profit organization. This year, the organization we have chosen to support is the Children's Shelter, which provides housing and support services for children who have been abused or neglected.\n\nWes Bos  26:22\nThat's great, Bruce. And how can people sign up for the event or make a donation?\n\nBruce  26:28\nWell, we have set up a donation page on our company's website where people can make a donation online. And for those who want to participate in the run/walk, they can register on the same page. We also have a team of volunteers who are helping to coordinate the event, so anyone who wants to get involved in that way can contact me or anyone else on the organizing committee.\n\nWes Bos  26:54\nFantastic. Thanks for sharing that, Bruce. I know our listeners will appreciate the opportunity to give back to the community in this way.",
