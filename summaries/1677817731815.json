Not too much I have I've been sort of taking my like logging a little bit more seriously, in the last couple of months, just because I had some like Gremlins in my app that I couldn't figure out like, where it was coming from and what would even cause this request and whatnot. And like, I just didn't have enough insight into like, it wasn't errors, or crashing or anything, it was just like, couldn't figure it out, you know. So we'll talk about like, what that is. So I sort of went through and updated my logging. I'm still not like, some of the stuff in this episode where I talked about I'm not using it. I'm mostly still just a console logger. But we'll yeah, let's get on into it. Yeah. Let's talk about our sponsor today, which is Sentry, Sentry is the air and exception, they do so much more of that they do performance, they do pro filings, and now they are getting into session replay, which will allow you to literally see what the user had done in your application to to trace through what's going on. So it's actually kind of funny that we talk about logging, because a lot of the stuff that Sentry does makes it so that you don't necessarily have to piece together logs. And we'll talk about what the difference is between those types of things. But check it out at Sentry dot i o use coupon code tasty treat that is going to get you two months for free. Thank you Sentry for sponsoring sick. All right, let's get into it. What do you want to give us a start up? Like why and what is logging? Yeah, so",

And these can be used primarily, you know, we often just throw it in for a quick debug or something like that. But you also probably have seen logging from other frameworks or other things that you've used, where you're automatically just getting some things coming in on your your console explaining what's happening, maybe at some given point, maybe it's explaining the requests that are coming in, maybe it's just saying, oh, you know, a message came in at this time or whatever. It depends on what system and what type of logging is enabled in this types of things. And in many, even like CMS has have, like baked in logging as well outside of the JavaScript context. But in at the end of the day logging is basically giving you visibility to some action that is happening on your server or your client, depending on how you're doing this. But it's very most basic. It's a console log. It's a I got here. But yeah, it's more complex. It's a, a get request was hit to this specific URL at this time.

Or I need to figure out why somebody specifically hit this URL with what data and it caused them something, you can log out that information, if you just want to see what endpoints are being hit with what specific data you can log that, or something just as simple as like an email was specifically sent. Well, we'll go a little bit more into the different types of logging. So it helps piecing together things helps us find ability. Worst case, I've certainly not had to do this before, thankfully, but I've heard of things crashing databases going down whatever.

Sometimes it's a little bit also, at the same time, more targeted and less targeted, because you can have less targeted info being logged, letting you know exactly what's happening around what are potential errors, but just what's happening in general.

Somebody starting to view a specific video, and then progress on that video being you can see all of that in your console, as it goes through. And I specifically had an issue where people were going to have magic links in my email, and people were going to magic links. And the idea of the magic Link was always undefined. It was the correct magic link. And immediately after it was undefined, and I could not for the life of me figure out what was triggering this undefined request, you know, like, it's not an error. It actually it was causing no issues to anybody except there was an undefined request in my log, and I could not figure it out for Life Media. Finally, finally trace it, trace it down. And you know, what it was, what it was an image tag to end, the source of the image was undefined. And it was trying to just, I guess, when you have an image tag, it tries to request the current URL as the source. And that was triggering, because I had like a catch all path setup for the ID in the URL. It was, it was catching that one as well. And literally, the the image pass, so I went into my template, and I go, Oh, I had like a typo in my template. And I fixed the image tag and whatnot. But that was driving me crazy. And it was only until I added additional logging. To see like, okay, like, is somebody being malicious here? Is this coming from the same user?

But you know, I think personally, what I like to see in a log is I like to see, you know, what type of what is I'm talking like server side logging here specifically? Yeah, one like really important thing about log is the timecode, in which this thing happened. Because without having the time in which something happened, you going back and referencing it is kind of pointless, right? You'd say at some point, in some time this, this event happened. But if you knew when an event happened, specifically, maybe an error on your site or something happened, right, and you want to investigate, so you're piling into the logs, having that time code that says this happened at this time, really important to be able to nail down exactly when scope when that happened. You know, also, I like what type of request it was a get post put whatever. I like the path that was requested. I like the total time of the response. I like those types of things in my logs. I also like to know what type of log this is, is this an information log? Is it an error?

You can go in and download and whatnot. Generally these log files are massive. so they they can't, you can and like, back in the day, it used to be hard to just open them up in your text editor. Text Editors are very good at opening up files that are two gigs and searching through them now. So it's not so much of an issue. But most services that do hosting will allow you to do what's called log drains, meaning that okay, we'll keep logs for we'll keep the last 10,000 logs, or we'll keep the last week worth of logs. And then after that they're deleted, because at some point, you should, you shouldn't keep logs around for that much longer. But if you do need to keep them for a little bit longer than you have to port them into something else. So whether that is as simple as a text file on AWS, or there's lots of services out there that are specific log drains, and they are really helpful because you can do things like search for specific words, you get syntax highlighting, you can filter sorting filters, or all that type of stuff and graphs and all Yeah, I don't do any of this.

They mention Winston as a popular option that allows for different types of logs and context passing.

There's, it's a really, it's really robust, it does a lot for you. low overhead, it's, uh, overall, a super nice logging package. But, you know, I would probably, instead of trying to use this in a sense, where you're dropping in like a console log, if something like this, like a service, I would probably try to like intercept, intercept errors or intercept requests and do this in more of like a middleware type of way. And then just use straight up console log everything else, I",

Yeah, totally. But But well, we'll throw that on the Bucks middleware. What's coming up? What else do we have here about logs?",
