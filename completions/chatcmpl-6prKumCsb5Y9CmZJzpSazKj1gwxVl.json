It is primarily used for debugging, but can also be used by frameworks to output information automatically. CMS systems often have baked-in logging. Logging provides visibility to actions happening on the client or server and can range from basic console logs to more complex information like request details and resolution time."

Different types of logging help in piecing together information and finding the ability, and can even help recreate lost data in databases."

Server-side logging is crucial and should include a time code, the type of request, the requested path, and the total response time. It is also important to differentiate between information and error logs, which can be color-coded accordingly for easier management."
